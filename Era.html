                <div class="text"> 24 Hour Psycho addresses the age-old discussion of women as emotional and, therefore, inferior or suspect–something to be managed. By owning the flippantly dismissive term “psycho,” Collins appropriates the concept of female hysteria and
                    celebrates it with powerful, intense and beautiful imagery of young women who have agency even in their distressed state.
                    <br><br> “Girls’ sadness is not passive, self-involved or shallow; it is a gesture of liberation, it is articulate and informed, it is a way of reclaiming agency over our bodies, identities, and lives.” – Audrey Wollen, artist, Sad

                    This Canadian photographer first became known on instagram. Now, he accumulates series of photos all marked by his artistic vision. Indeed, his images so particular are strongly colored in a heavy or mysterious atmosphere retranscribed through colors
                    touching the eyes of the viewer by their subtlety, their composition and their modern and fresh aesthetic aspect.
                    <br><br> He often plays with lights and shadows and regularly puts a subject (sometimes himself) on stage. His pictures are recognizable among the countless photographers creating works in the same artistic register.
                    <br> <br>His tools to create such images are numerous: from the fog machine to projectors. Indeed, he uses lights of all kinds and above all, he manages to renew himself with each finished image. His imagination is limitless. </div>

                        In the clip "come 4 me" for ABRA, he puts forward the young singer in a colored neon decor, where he plays with the alternation of the position of the lights to retranscribe different atmospheres. Through this minimalist clip, we find the subtlety, the
                        elegance and the purity of his works that document and explore a new aesthetic of blackness.

                        It is the youthful culture of black Americans that is at the heart of this artist's work, whose photographs are filled with strength, pride and a strong sense of style. Solemn, the portraits presented are as natural as possible, seeking a frontal confrontation
                        with the viewer, challenging his perception, without artifice.
